You are solely responsible for managing your funds and for maintaining the security of your private Key and any mnemonic passphrase (‘backup words’) associated with your wallet.",

        "I_INFO": "1.1 When you create a wallet account, it generates a mnemonic passphrase (‘backup words’) consisting of 24 English words and a public and private keypair used to send and receive digital currency. You must backup your mnemonic passphrase and private key information and keep it secure; failure to do so may result in the loss of control of the assets within your wallet.",

This information is stored locally on the user’s own device. Hence, we cannot assist you with wallet retrieval. The Development Team is only responsible for guaranteeing wallet access and fixing software bugs, and is unable to restore encrypted private keys or otherwise recover private keys. If you use MyETPWallet.com, you acknowledge that Metaverse is not responsible for safeguarding or maintaining private keys associated with the wallet. We strongly advise you to back up your wallet files to best protect your property rights.",

For example, we implement high-standard encryption techniques such as SSL to protect your personal information. Please be advised that we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any data you disclose online, due to technical limitations and unforeseeable hostile actions against the platform. By using our service, the user acknowledges the possibility that the system and telecommunication network they use to access our service can be compromised, which is out of our control. For instance, the software the user has downloaded or websites visited may contain viruses or malwares that threaten the security of the wallet information. Therefore, it is imperative that users ensure the security of their personal information and data. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing online over the internet and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence. The development team recommends that users pay special attention to backing up password and private keys offline (e.g. writing them on a piece of paper).",

The developers from the Metaverse Team will take appropriate technical measures in accordance with industry standards to protect data security on the user’s device but are not legally responsible of any data or funds loss.
